## Decomposition Strategy

### 1. Task Analysis Framework
**Break down the complex task by asking:**
- [ ] **What are the major phases or stages?** (Usually 3-5 main phases)
- [ ] **What are the key deliverables?** (Concrete outputs at each stage)
- [ ] **What expertise is required?** (Different skills for different phases)
- [ ] **What are the natural handoff points?** (Where work can be transferred)

### 2. Subtask Identification Matrix

**For each potential subtask, consider:**

| Subtask | Deliverable | Skills Needed | Dependencies | Effort | Owner |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1. | | | | | |
| 2. | | | | | |
| 3. | | | | | |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

### 3. Dependency Mapping
**Critical Path Analysis:**
- [ ] Which subtasks must be completed sequentially?
- [ ] Which subtasks can be worked on in parallel?
- [ ] Where are the bottlenecks or single points of failure?
- [ ] What external dependencies exist outside the team?

**Dependency Relationships:**
- **Sequential:** Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
- **Parallel:** Tasks can be worked on simultaneously
- [ ] **Prerequisites:** Tasks that provide inputs to other tasks
- **Optional:** Tasks that enhance but are not critical to completion

### 4. Resource Allocation Strategy`, teamSize)

	// Adjust guidance based on team size
	switch teamSize {
	case "1":
		promptText += `
**Single Person Approach:**
- [ ] Focus on clear sequential phases to avoid context switching
- [ ] Create natural stopping points for progress evaluation
- [ ] Plan work packages that can be completed in 1-3 day chunks
- [ ] Build in buffer time for learning and problem-solving`

	default:
		promptText += `
**Team Collaboration Strategy:**
- [ ] Assign subtasks based on individual expertise and interests
- [ ] Ensure clear interfaces between different people's work
- [ ] Plan regular integration points to combine individual efforts
- [ ] Define communication protocols for dependencies and blockers
- [ ] Consider pairing for knowledge transfer and quality assurance`
	}

	promptText += `

### 5. Subtask Definition Template

**For each identified subtask:**

**Subtask Name:** [Clear, action-oriented name]

**Objective:** [What specific outcome should be achieved]

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] [Concrete output 1]
- [ ] [Concrete output 2]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [How to know when this subtask is complete]
- [ ] [Quality standards or measurements]

**Dependencies:**
- **Requires:** [What must be done first]
- **Provides to:** [What other subtasks need this work]

**Effort Estimate:** [Time investment required]

**Skills Required:** [Expertise or knowledge needed]

**Potential Risks:** [What could go wrong]

### 6. Integration Planning
- [ ] **Integration Points:** When and how will subtask outputs be combined?
- [ ] **Quality Gates:** What reviews or checkpoints ensure standards?
- [ ] **Communication Plan:** How will the team coordinate and share progress?
- [ ] **Change Management:** How will scope changes be handled?

### 7. Recommended Subtask Structure

**Phase 1: Foundation/Setup**
- Research and requirements gathering
- Environment setup and tool preparation
- Stakeholder alignment and planning finalization

**Phase 2: Core Development/Execution**
- Primary work packages (the main effort)
- Regular progress reviews and adjustments
- Quality assurance and testing

**Phase 3: Integration/Completion**
- Component integration and system testing
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Stakeholder review and acceptance

## Next Steps Checklist
- [ ] Create individual tasks for each identified subtask
- [ ] Set up dependency relationships in the task management system
- [ ] Assign owners and estimated timelines for each subtask
- [ ] Schedule integration points and team check-ins
- [ ] Document the overall breakdown approach for future reference
